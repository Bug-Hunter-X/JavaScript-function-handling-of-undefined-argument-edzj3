# JavaScript Function: Handling Undefined Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: neglecting to handle the `undefined` argument in a function. The `bug.js` file contains the faulty function that doesn't explicitly check for `undefined`, leading to unexpected results when `undefined` is passed as an argument. 

The `bugSolution.js` file presents the corrected version which explicitly addresses this case, providing a robust and predictable function behavior.

This example highlights the importance of rigorous input validation in JavaScript to avoid runtime errors and ensure code reliability.
